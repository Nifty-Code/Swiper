            didSwipe(item: item, action: action) // <--- Handle Swipe action here
        }
        .rotationRatio(50.0) // <--- Rotation ratio in degrees per points of the horizontal translation
        .swipeThreshold(50.0) // <--- The minimum horizontal translation threshold required to register a swipe action
